# Lagrangian-Based Research Trading Strategy

This Python script implements a simplified trading strategy inspired by concepts from **Lagrangian mechanics**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is a **conceptual and illustrative application** of Lagrangian ideas ‚Äî not a strict formulation. It is intended to guide further research into using physical principles in quantitative finance.

## Requirements

Ensure the following are installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Python
Download Python from:  
üëâ [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Download the Script

### Lagrangian Mechanics (Research-Inspired)
In classical mechanics, the **Lagrangian** is defined as the difference between kinetic and potential energy. This strategy draws an analogy:
- **Kinetic energy** ‚Üî Price velocity or rate of return
- **Potential energy** ‚Üî Market volatility or uncertainty

## Features

- Implements a physics-inspired trading strategy using Lagrangian mechanics concepts.
- Calculates kinetic and potential energy of asset price movements.
- Derives the Lagrangian (KE - PE) to assess dominance of momentum vs mean reversion.
- Identifies buy signals based on thresholds for Lagrangian and price velocity.
- Visualizes price, velocity, energies, and Lagrangian with matplotlib.
- Outputs potential buy signals to the terminal and saves them to a `.txt` file.
- Applies moving averages to model price reversion behavior.

## Disclaimer

**This code is presented solely for educational purposes**, illustrating a conceptual trading strategy. The methods used for identifying significant price zones and generating trading signals are highly simplified and should not be considered suitable for real-world trading.

Developing a viable trading strategy requires:

- Sophisticated techniques for identifying market forces
- Rigorous backtesting across various market conditions
- Careful parameter optimization
- A comprehensive understanding of financial market risks

We assume **no responsibility or liability** for any losses incurred by individuals attempting to use this illustrative code for actual trading activities. **Trading in financial markets carries substantial risk**, and individuals should conduct thorough independent research and seek professional financial advice before making any trading decisions.
